Arduino C++ Follow The Wall Robotics Dawson Engineering Lab Component

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:
- Received full marks for navigating "maze" under 30 seconds.
- Programmed a non-linear and dynamic pathing all under two hours.
- Assembled and adjusted a robot (motors, ultrasonic sensor, motherboard and frame)

SKILLS:
- Arduino
- Arduino IDE
- Basic C++
- Troubleshooting / Testing
- Robot Assembly
- Considered real-time variables, such as faulty components, friction.

CONTEXT:

Virtual and Physical Components

The lab component required students to assemble an arduino robot given a frame, two motors, an ultrasonic sensor and a motherboard.
Students were responsible of assembling and programming the robots using Arduino IDE.

During official grading, students were presented with a "maze/ wall" and were tasked to have the robot follow the wall WITHOUT linear
pathing. Students were unaware of the orientation of the maze prior to demo (on the spot programming).
